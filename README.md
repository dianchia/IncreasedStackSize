# Increased Stack Size

Feeling that your inventory is always full of stone when mining?
Wish to increase the stack size of items?
This is the perfect mod for you!

## Setting the multiplier

To set the multiplier, run the command "/setstacksizemultiplier" in the game.\
Starting from version 1.1.0, new command is available now.
You can now use the command "/stacksize set 10" to set the stack size multiplier
and the command "/stacksize get" to check the stack size multiplier.\
**Note that you can only run this command if you have permission higher or equals to "OWNER"**\
Please only give this permission to someone you trust.

## Multiplayer

This mod needs to be downloaded for both host and client if playing in multiplayer.

## Important Notes

- Game have to be **restarted** for the changes to be made on the stack size.
- If you decrease the multiplier, **DO NOT** sort your inventory or any chest as you will lose the item that has stack
  size more than current maximum stack size.
  Instead, drop the item on the ground and pick it up again.

_Disclaimer: The mod author is not responsible to any item lost due to incorrect usage of this mod_

## Known Bugs
