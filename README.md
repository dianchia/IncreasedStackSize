# Increased Stack Size

Feeling that your inventory is always full of stone when mining?
Wish to increase the stack size of items?
This is the perfect mod for you!

~~Currently, the mod only increase the stack size by 5x.
In the future, when official mod configuration is implemented, the multiplier can be defined by you!~~

Now you can modify the multiplier by running the game once after you updated the mod (>= v0.3.1).
After that, right click you game in Steam library &rarr; Manage &rarr; Browse local files.
In `settings/increasedStackSize/settings.cfg`, modify `multiplier=5` to any number you like.
Example: `multiplier=10`.


## Important Notes:
- Game have to be **restarted** for the changes to be made on the stack size.
- If you decrease the multiplier, **DO NOT** sort your inventory or any chest as you will lose the item that has stack size more than current maximum stack size.
Instead, drop the item on the ground and pick it up again.
