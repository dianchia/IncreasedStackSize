# Increased Stack Size

Feeling that your inventory is always full of stone when mining?
Wish to increase the stack size of items?
This is the perfect mod for you!

~~Currently, the mod only increase the stack size by 5x.
In the future, when official mod configuration is implemented, the multiplier can be defined by you!~~

Now you can modify the multiplier by running the game once after you updated the mod (v0.3.1).
After that, right click you game in Steam library &rarr; Manage &rarr; Browse local files.
In `settings/increasedStackSize/settings.cfg`, modify `multiplier=5` to any number you like.
Example: `multiplier=10`
